# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Welcome to `dotify`, which is a `bash` script that lets you generate the dotfile `git` repository and manage it. It's a reboot based on the older [dotman](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/dotman) script created by the original developer, Bhupesh Varshney.

To use this script, you can just use:

```
$ dotify
```

To learn how to use this script, go to any link in the left side of your screen.
