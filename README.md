# Welcome!

Welcome to `dotify`, which is a `bash` script that lets you generate the dotfile `git` repository and manage it. It's a reboot based on the older [dotman](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/dotman) script created by the original developer, Bhupesh Varshney.

It allows you to manage your dotfiles and version them using a Git repository as the medium, while it gives you the ability to compare them between a local version and a remote version. This works as a synchronization tool for your dotfiles for quicker deployment to many machines.

It does not only support dotfiles, but you can also manage and version your dotfolders, too!
