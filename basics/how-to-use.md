# ‚ùì How to use

Running this script is so easy. Just run the script with no arguments to start the dashboard:

```
dotify
```

If the repo configuration file, `~/.config/dotify.repo`, is not generated yet, it'll present you the prompt where you can enter your own dotfiles repository URL. This URL is going to be printed to the file.

If you don't have an existing repository, you can create one. GitHub and GitLab let you create your free Git repository.
